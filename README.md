# ULTIMATE-TEAM-RACE
 
It is an application to manage a race with the aim of knowing in real time the points of each team and each rider in order to have the final result and to attribute the merit to the winner.
The result is known from each point of the rider from his time and his penalties during each stage. Each rider's points are accumulated at the end of each stage giving him a provisional classification and will have an influence on the classification of his team.
